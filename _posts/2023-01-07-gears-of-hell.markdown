## Gameplay Mechanics

In **Gears of Hell**, you must control a lone mercenary battling through relentless waves of enemies. The game emphasizes resource management, skillful shooting, and strategic decision-making. As you progress, you'll need to collect coins from defeated enemies to purchase **new weapons**, **ammunition**, and **upgrades** at in-game shops.

### Shooting & Weapons
- You start with a basic **pistol** that has unlimited ammunition, but you can unlock more powerful weapons like **submachine guns**, **shotguns**, and **assault rifles** through the in-game shop.
- Each weapon has unique characteristics, from **high damage** sniper shots to **fast-firing submachine guns**.
- Players must carefully manage their **ammunition**, as only the basic pistol has infinite rounds.

### Movement & Controls
The player character moves in a **top-down** perspective, with responsive movement designed to help you **dodge enemy attacks**. The controls vary depending on whether you play on a **PC** or a **mobile device**, ensuring an optimal experience on both platforms.

### Shop System & Upgrades

The in-game shop is crucial for your survival. Here, you can purchase **upgraded weapons**, **ammunition**, and **passive perks** that improve your abilities. The shop features two sections:

- **Weapons and Ammunition**: Buy new guns or stock up on ammo for your current arsenal.
- **Passive Perks**: Unlock powerful enhancements like increased firing speed, improved health, or faster movement.

Perks can be upgraded up to **five levels**, making them even more powerful, but choose wiselyâ€”you can only equip a limited number of perks during each playthrough.
