## Rocket Yan: A Thrilling Space Adventure

> **"Controlling a ship has never been so challenging."**

**Rocket Yan** is an exciting arcade game where you control a spaceship powered by two independent rockets. Your mission? Navigate through levels filled with obstacles, carefully adjusting your thrust to reach the landing point without crashing. It's a game that demands precision, patience, and skill.

Developed as part of the **IPMU** course for the **GDDV degree** (Quintana) at **URJC** (21/22), **Rocket Yan** is a project built by a small team of three passionate developers.

### Game Features:
- **4 skill-based levels** with increasing difficulty.
- **Unique control mechanics** using independent thrusters.
- **Challenge your friends** and set records for the fastest landing times.
- **Gamepad compatibility** for a more immersive experience.

**A challenge awaits you. See you in space!**

## Custom Controller: An Immersive Experience

One of the standout features of **Rocket Yan** is the **custom-built controller** designed specifically for this game. The game’s simple controls—managing the power of two thrusters—prompted the team to create a unique controller that simulates the feeling of being inside the spaceship. This controller features two gradual levers, providing a more authentic and tactile experience for players.

However, if you don’t have access to the custom controller, don’t worry! **Rocket Yan** is fully compatible with standard gamepads, where you can use the triggers (preferably analog) to control the thrusters with precision.
